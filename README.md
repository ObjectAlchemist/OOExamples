# OOExamples

## Description
This repository contains examples that show how to use objects of the OOSwift repositories (OOBase, OOFoundation, OOUIKit, ...).

## Object orientation
All objects follow these rules:
- they are immutable, except 
    - the 'Memory' objects, these are low level in memory stores
    - some bridge objects to the apple api
- they implement a protocol that defines the api of the object
    - an object is only allowed to implement one protocol
    - only a decorator may implement a second one
- they use dependency injection, but only protocols will be injected
- they are final, except
    - the 'Wrap' objects, these objects are designed to derive for object compositions

## Additional OOP rules for applications
An ideal application only contains 'Wrap' compositions of objects.

## Usage
Clone it and fetch dependencies with carthage by calling "carthage update".

## Regenerate project
The xcodeproj can be generated by using [Phoenx](https://github.com/jensmeder/Phoenx).
